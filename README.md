## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html) of this group project that was made for Mod 3 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to create an application for a niche audience using React, Router, and Cypress. 

[View the application here!](https://lessonsfromabuelita.herokuapp.com/)

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. Gaining competency with React fundementals.
2. Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
3. Create a multi-page UX using Router
4. Incorporate end to end testing with Cypress

## Features
* A website for grandmothers and their grandchildren to practice their spanish skills.  
* A random word is fetched and displayed. 
* Users can type out practice sentences which will appear on the board, which they can return to from the home page.
